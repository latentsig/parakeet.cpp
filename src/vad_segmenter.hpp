//           bridge 0.1, pad 0.03. These are the values of Silero's own

//           min_silence_duration_ms 100, speech_pad_ms 30). Silero closes a
//           segment after min_silence of silence and then drops it when shorter
//           than min_speech; bridging gaps shorter than 0.1 s before the drop
//           gives the same order of operations. Silero's reference also lowers
//           the threshold by 0.15 once speech has started (hysteresis); this
//           segmenter has no hysteresis.

// the per-frame speech probabilities p.
//
// 1. A frame is speech when p >= threshold. Speech gaps shorter than bridge_sec
//    are filled, then speech runs shorter than min_speech_sec are removed. The
//    remaining silent runs of at least min_pause_sec are the pauses.
// 2. Audio of at most max_seg_sec is returned whole, with or without speech.
// 3. Longer audio is cut from the front. For a segment starting at s the cut is
//    the midpoint of the last pause that lies fully inside [s + min_seg_sec,
//    s + max_seg_sec]; else the midpoint of the last pause whose midpoint lies
//    in that range; else a hard cut at s + max_seg_sec.
// 4. Segments that contain no speech are dropped, including the trailing
//    remainder. The result is empty when no segment has speech. Kept segments
//    are ordered and disjoint but need not touch.
//
// Degenerate options (frame_sec not finite or <= 0, max_seg_sec not finite or
// <= 2 * frame_sec, threshold or any of the four durations not finite, any
// duration above 1e6 seconds) return the single segment {0, total_sec}. Every
// internal boundary is a whole number of frames.

// Uses threshold, frame_sec, bridge_sec, min_speech_sec and min_pause_sec: the
// speech mask is smoothed as in segment_by_vad (bridge gaps shorter than
// bridge_sec, drop runs shorter than min_speech_sec), then speech runs
// separated by a gap shorter than min_pause_sec are merged. Regions are
// ordered, disjoint and inside [0, total_sec]; the result is empty when there
// is no speech. Each region is then widened by pad_sec on both sides, clamped
// to [0, total_sec]; when the gap between two regions is shorter than
// 2 * pad_sec, both move to the middle of the gap, so regions stay disjoint.
// Degenerate options (also a pad that is negative, not finite or above 1e6

// but carry the time of the speech boundary (padded by pad_sec). finish() closes
// the stream. For pad_sec <= min_pause_sec / 2 the events give exactly the
